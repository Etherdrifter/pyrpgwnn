== Managing the database schema ==

When a change has been made to the model, you need to update the
database schema to reflect the change. The command to do this is:

  ./manage.py db migrate

This will create an additional file in the migrations directory
which should be committed.
Next the migration needs to be applied to the database using:

  ./manage.py db upgrade

If you have pulled a new copy of the git repository and notice
the migrations directory has extra files, just run the upgrade
command. This is because the person who updated the schema will
have run the migrate command to create the migration files 
already and all you need to do is upgrade your database.
