Clone the repository BEFORE setting up the virtual environment since you
can't git clone into a non-empty directory.

  git clone https://github.com/rpgwnn/pyrpgwnn.git pyrpgwnn

Assuming your system default is Python 2, but you have installed Python 3
separately, you'll need to create a virtual environment that uses Python 3.
The command is likely to be something like this:

  virtualenv-3.3 pyrpgwnn

If you only have Python 3, you can use the normal virtualenv program.

  virtualenv pyrpgwnn

The virtual environment should create several directories including bin,
include and lib. The project .gitignore is setup to exclude those from
the repository and you should not create anything project specific in
these directories.

Before doing any development, ensure you activate the virtual environment.

  source pyrpgwnn/bin/activate

Next:

  cd pyrpgwnn

and then you can run the application, hack on the code, etc.
