Clone the repository BEFORE setting up the virtual environment since you
can't git clone into a non-empty directory.

If you are looking to help develop pyrpgwnn, you should use github's "Fork"
option at https://github.com/rpgwnn/pyrpgwnn to create a copy within your
own github account. Once that has been done, you should use the clone URL
of your forked repository in the following command.

  git clone https://github.com/rpgwnn/pyrpgwnn.git pyrpgwnn

Assuming your system default is Python 2, but you have installed Python 3
separately, you'll need to create a virtual environment that uses Python 3.
The command is likely to be something like this:

  virtualenv-3.3 pyrpgwnn

If you only have Python 3 installed on your system, you can use the normal
virtualenv program.

  virtualenv pyrpgwnn

The virtual environment should create several directories including bin,
include and lib. The project .gitignore is setup to exclude those from
the repository and you should not create anything project specific in
these directories.

Before doing any development, ensure you activate the virtual environment.

  source pyrpgwnn/bin/activate

Next:

  cd pyrpgwnn

and then you can run the application, hack on the code, etc.

If you have not yet installed any of the required Python modules into
the virtual environment, you should run:

  pip install -r requirements.txt

After this, setup the database

  ./shell.py
  >>> from pyrpgwnn import db
  >>> db.create_all()
  >>> quit()

the file pyrpgwnn/rpgwnn.db has been created
